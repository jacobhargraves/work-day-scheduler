# Workday Calendar

## Description

This is a simple application that provides a workday calendar (hours 9am to 5pm).  It allows the user to enter a discription or event for the hour of their choosing, save it, and have it be logged into local storage so that the user can refresh the page and their input will still be there.  In addition, it is styled to show which times are past, present, and in the future.  It also shows the date and time at the top of the page.
